# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Project Description
This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) implementation that revolves around a command interpreter for managing and interacting with various models. The models directory contains classes representing different objects or instances, while the models/engine directory houses storage classes, with file_storage.py being the current implementation.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter is accessed through the console.py file, serving as the entry point. It provides functionality to create, manage, and interact with different models.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the following command:
```bash
python console.py
```

### How to Use
Once the interpreter is running, you can use various commands to manipulate models, storage, and perform other actions.

### Examples
- To create a new instance:
  ```python
  create <class_name>
  ```

- To display all instances of a class:
  ```python
  show <class_name> <id>
  ```

- Additional commands and functionalities can be explored within the interpreter.

## Testing
All unit tests for the project are located in the tests directory. Ensure to run tests regularly to maintain the integrity of the codebase.
